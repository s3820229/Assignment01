Brief background about myself
To give myself a more formal introduction my name is Jared Matthews. I was born in Adelaide, South Australia and is still where I reside today. I live with my brother, partner and our two kids. The eldest being 4 and the youngest is 2. We also have with us, if that weren’t enough under one roof, two beautiful dogs. The eldest is a gorgeous Rottweiler X Bullmastiff X Ridgeback X God knows what else and he is 2 years old. The other is a handsome purebred Rottweiler that was naturally born without a tail. To many people’s disbelief. He was actually born on the date that I am writing this 1 year ago (28/08/2018). And, yes, before you even think about raising the question it was of course made to be a very special day.
In my free time I enjoy spending time with my kids. We go to the park together as a family, dogs included. I also enjoy another new found hobby of mine that is not programming, but much more outdoors and that is skateboarding. I am still finding my way on the board, but I very much enjoy it as a quick break away from me having my head stuck into my computer. 

What is your interest in IT?
The answer to what interests me a lot about IT comes down to a whole lot of curiosity. I’m very curious about how much I can learn, how I will apply that knowledge, how it all works and of course how far will all of it as a unit advance? These are all questions that I ask myself. I thoroughly look forward to my future in IT.  

When did your interest in IT start?
It is difficult for me to pin point when my interest in IT officially started. I think as a general thumb everybody is fascinated by technology. I’ve been playing games from a very young age, from PC to other platforms too. Had there been more structured programs in my school I would have most certainly realised sooner that this is how I’d like to spend my working days. In a career that’s forever evolving.

Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
I do not remember there being anyone that piqued my interest in IT. What I do remember though was creating a very simple command application that forced the computer to shut down. I think I must have searched computer pranks when I was very young, because I remember making the simple application, disguising it with a different name and icon, to then copying it to my USB to place on other people’s computers at school. I used to be rather cheeky and immature. I am slowly growing out of it now. But, not enough to forget what the target was;

“C:\Windows\System32\shutdown.exe -s -t 25 -c "Enter text here."”
	C:\Windows\System32
(Target location)
	shutdown.exe
(Target)
	-s = shutdown -t = time -c = comment
(Explanation)
That is when I think I realised the fun you can have with computers. Even if it were just a simple prank. It was hysterical seeing them look at me as a wizard while I laughed to make it obvious to them who was responsible. 

Outline your IT experience (if any).
As far as my IT experience goes it is as far as my interest has taken me. I have considered taking the “self-taught” route, but I really just did not know where to start. I also figured that given my age I have had enough of wasting time. I know I would thoroughly enjoy a career in this field so why not get an internationally accredited qualification out of it?

Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
I chose to join RMIT for my degree because I was told that there is no better place in Australia to study Information Technology. I asked some questions on the RMIT website enquiring what kind of support and structure is based around the subjects and I was ensured that as a complete beginner I would ease into it comfortably. Truthfully, if I am to give back my two cents, I would have to admit that I have not been lied to. Based on the feedback already received by some lecturers all I can say is I respect and appreciate their time, direction and kind words. 

What do you expect to learn during your studies?
During my studies at RMIT what I am expecting to learn is a thorough introduction to of course IT itself, but particularly programming as I believe that is where my main interests are. I am also hoping to learn that IT is just as valuable as studying Computer Science. I say that because my future career specifically asks for at least a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science first hand, but then also mentions “or equivalent” and I would have loved to of pursued that, but unfortunately it was not available to me. So, I’m rolling with this one.

What do you hope to do after graduation?
After graduation I am hoping to get into the military as perhaps a Cyber Warfare Officer. If they cannot make a vacancy for me there I will more than likely find myself doing anything else that I am qualified to do or something else that I can be trained for. After serving for a few years I will have gained valuable experience and with that I plan to then apply for what I really want and what I really want is to start my career somewhere as a software engineer. I know they will most certainly be two different areas of IT. One resolving a whole lot around security and the other developing software, but you have got to start somewhere.
The reason I want to join the military is because it is one of those things that I have seen myself doing for a very long time now, I just did not know what it is that I would be doing exactly. I kind of feel like it is something that I just have to do. Along the way I will most certainly learn many things such as; self-discipline, confidence, team-work, etc. The perks I see at the end of it is what is important to me. What with being a family man, it will prove to be a major positive impact because I know I will have the benefits provided to my kids for my service.

My ideal job and its description.
It has been a rather significant dream of mine, and I think many others, to work at the facilities of Rockstar Games. The reason why I see this as such a great deal is because it comes with many other goals along the way. I will of course have to be qualified for the job, hence why I am studying for this degree. Not only that, but it also forces me to see another part of the world, one that I have had intentions to see for numerous reasons.
Following through with this dream of mine will most certainly prove that I am capable of anything that I set my mind too. It is also very exciting to think what that job environment is truly like. I would be working with some of the finest programming applications, some of the best people of the industry and one of the best parts of the job is I hear they serve free delicious food. There are of course many more reasons than that as to why I wish to pursue this position sometime in the future. A big one being that I have always been magnetised back to many of their games (made by Rockstar) in the past and even the present. The wonder behind how they create something so realistic – yet so imaginative. The ability to consolidate my own ideas someday and really make a big positive effect to the history in the making of Rockstar Games keeps me significantly motivated.
As the criteria below suggests in order to be considered for any of these positions you must at least have a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent. In saying that it is also favourably more admired if you have previous experience in the game making industry. In fact, the job description asks that you have a prior two years’ experience in commercial games programming as well as having shipped at least one game title on either Xbox and/ or PlayStation. I am well aware that gathering all these skills, qualifications and experience will take some time. I would love it if it were the case that I knew a long time ago that this was the career I knew to pursue. But that is not the case and with that being said I am still grateful for that, because in front of me I have the excitement of looking forward to all these things and with the motivation I possess someday I will be there.

My belief towards many of these tests that supposedly shed light on the type of person you are, or the personality you have, or what your emotions make of you, etc, is that I believe it truly does not serve righteous justice to who you really are as a person. Especially when you take into consideration the actions that you or others would do realistically. It is easy to tick all the boxes that make a perfect human being or employee and so on. But when it really comes down to the nitty gritty the true answers would reveal differently. So, the results of this test means’ absolute zilch to me. At the end of the day I know who I am and when it comes the time to work in a team, I am more than capable of throwing myself out there to let others know where I am at and how I feel I would best contribute to the team.
Then again, on the other hand we have what I think to be a really valid test. Which is the speed typing test, listed below. I certainly do think that could be an important end result leading to a job. It can be important in many working businesses to have a certain entry of speed within typing on a computer. So, the results of that could be seen highly valuable to an employer of which you are trying to impress.
 
Describe your project idea. 
For my project I would love to develop an educational mobile application that can very clearly teach you a new language, that language being Spanish in particular. I would love to add feature such as interaction to the user via voice simulations. You have to correctly pronounce the words and also properly spell them with the right accents on letters before progressing any further. I would aim to make it a very personalised experience to motivate the user to coming back. There can be chapters of learning put in place as well as scenarios. The application could prove to be of extreme value especially to those who are travelling to Spain and other Spanish speaking areas. Because Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the WORLD, I imagine that if an app is approached the right way and makes Spanish so incredibly simple to learn it could spread like wild fire. 

Why do you think it is important or interesting?
I think it is highly important because I have used a few English to Spanish learning applications myself and because of that I realised that if I can make my own idea come to life it could prove to be of easier education to others. It gets the user involved and so the applications responsibility is to always be on the same page as the user. There is an estimated 437 million people that do speak Spanish. That leaves plenty motivation alone to want to learn it. Not to mention that also leaves an added estimated amount of 74 billion that don’t know Spanish. 

What are the potential drawbacks or obstacles that you anticipate on encountering?
Some potential drawbacks that I anticipate on encountering are perhaps making clear errors in the translation. Obviously since I am not fluent at speaking Spanish, I suppose I am bound to make at least a few mistakes. Another one I know for sure is that of creating the voice recognition in order to progress with the lessons available on the app. I have no idea of what the programming would look like for that, but I am fully assuming it to be extremely difficult. I am also anticipating on storing users progress as being an obstacle that I may indefinitely encounter. 

What are you passionate about?
I am passionate about my newly found hobby which is programming. I run into many errors along my travels, but it doesn’t set me back. I am significantly stubborn, committed and dedicated when it comes to encountering errors, set-backs, etc. I don’t seem to let go and I am in constant need to better myself. Especially since I see myself working in much harder environments. What I mean by that is obviously once I hit my dream career, I will be handling much more heavier forms of coding, hardware and so on.



What kind of IT innovation would you like to see?
I would love to see a lot of user interaction stuff, as well as user interface. I think my passion in IT leans heavily on the user experience side of things. Applications for example, I love a very personalised experience that comes along with many customizable options as possible. 

What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?
I think my project idea of making an application that teaches you to speak another language is a good start in the direction of heading towards my ideal job. Because either way, in order for me to be qualified in my desired field I will need all sorts of different experience behind me and so I figure why not make something I would like for myself? I was briefly learning Spanish before joining this course and the only reason I stopped is because I thought my brain would be preoccupied enough taking on board all the things that I hope to learn in these subjects.
